# DevContainer Toolbox

A comprehensive development container setup that provides a consistent development environment across Windows, Mac, and Linux. This toolbox includes configurations and tools for working with Azure infrastructure, data platforms, security operations, development, and monitoring.

## About

The DevContainer Toolbox provides:

- A pre-configured development environment using Debian 12 Bookworm
- Essential base tools including Azure CLI, Python, Node.js, and common command-line utilities
- Core VS Code extensions for Azure development, PowerShell, Markdown, and YAML support
- Extensible architecture allowing easy addition of role-specific tools
- Consistent environment across all development machines

## Problem Solved

- Eliminates "it works on my machine" issues by providing a standardized development environment
- Simplifies onboarding of new developers with a ready-to-use development setup
- Allows safe experimentation with new tools without affecting your local machine
- Provides a modular approach to adding role-specific development tools
- Ensures consistent tooling across team members regardless of their operating system

## What are DevContainers, and why is everyone talking about it?

- [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
- [Youtube: Get Started with Dev Containers in VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1RavPr_878&t=38s)

## Installation requirements

### Prerequisites

- Install Docker preferably via Rancher Desktop instead of Docker Desktop ([Read more about why here.](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/awb-rancher-desktop-alternative-to-docker-desktop)). The [installation of Rancher Desktop is defined here](.devcontainer/setup/setup-windows.md).


### How to set it up in your project

1. Open the directory where you would like to store the devcontainers repository.
2. Open a terminal window and execute the following command to fetch and execute the download script. The script will download 2 folders into your current working folder, .devcontainer and .devcontainer.extend.

If you are using windows
```powershell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/norwegianredcross/devcontainer-toolbox/refs/heads/main/update-devcontainer.ps1 -O update-devcontainer.ps1; .\update-devcontainer.ps1
```

If you are using Mac/Linux
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/norwegianredcross/devcontainer-toolbox/refs/heads/main/update-devcontainer.sh -O update-devcontainer.sh && chmod +x update-devcontainer.sh && ./update-devcontainer.sh
```

3. Open your repository in VS Code by running `code .`
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"

## How to extend the devcontainer

Add project dependencies to the script [project-installs.sh](.devcontainer.extend/project-installs.sh) and the next developer will thank you.
See [readme-devcontainer-extend.md](.devcontainer.extend/readme-devcontainer-extend.md)

## Alternate IDEs

This howto uses vscode. But you can use other IDEs.
